# Cake-ordering-system
This project "Cake ordering system" is developed in the JAVA language. This is a microproject that is developed using all the features of advanced Java. The application is cmd based, the output can be seen using the frame in java. I've used swing components such as TabbedPane, Form components, etc. for developing this application. I've integrated Java Database Connectivity by connecting this application with oracle. When the form is filled by the user the contents given by the user are stored in a database. The application initially displays the information about the Bakery and the types of cakes they provide. In the contact section, all the information about the bakery owner is displayed such as the contact number, address, etc. The application also contains two forms one for ordering the cake and the other for giving feedback to the bakery owner. The whole application is contained in a tabbed pane with vertical tabs provided we can traverse through them by selecting the appropriate name for the tab.
